## STARK CINEMAX
An app that allows clients to view movie details and purchase movie tickets.

## Description

This project is a web application that allows users to vote for their favorite animals. It displays a collection of animal cards, each containing the pet's name, image, vote count, and a button to increase the vote(like) count. Users can click on an animal's name to view additional details about the pet.

Main Features:
1. New pets can be added to the Pet Palace database
2. Added and existing pets can be viewed on the pets list 
3. Pets can be voted for by clickin the 'like' icon. Likes are stored on the database
4. Pets can also be deleted from the database by clicking the delete icon at the bottom of the card


The application utilizes JavaScript and interacts with a RESTful API to retrieve and update data. It makes use of the Fetch API to perform HTTP requests to the backend server. The server stores the animal data and provides endpoints for fetching all animals, updating vote counts, and resetting vote counts.

The frontend code is built with `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript`. It uses `DOM manipulation` to dynamically render the animal cards and handle user interactions such as voting and resetting vote counts. Event listeners are attached to the vote and reset buttons to perform the corresponding actions.

The code also includes a `form submission` functionality. The form captures user input from various input fields and creates an object representing the form data. This object is then sent to the server using a POST request.

Overall, this project provides an interactive and engaging user experience for voting on favorite animals. It demonstrates the use of frontend technologies, API integration, and data manipulation in a web application context.

## Project Setup
To set up the project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file  in your preferred code editor.
3. start the db.json server.
4. Run the `index.html` file using live server which will open the page on your default browser.
5. Interact with the interface as desired.
