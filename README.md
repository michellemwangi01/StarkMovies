## STARK CINEMAX
An app that allows clients to view movie details and purchase movie tickets.

## Description

This project is a web application that allows users to purchase movie tickets. It displays a collection of movie cards, each containing the movie's name, image, additional details, and a button to purchase tickets  Users can click on an movie's name to view additional details about the pet.

Main Features:
1. Existing pets can be viewed on the pets list 
3. Movies can be purchased by clicking the 'buy' icon. Tickets purchased are stored on the database
4. Movies can also be deleted from the database by clicking the delete icon at the bottom of the card


The application utilizes JavaScript and interacts with a RESTful API to retrieve and update data. It makes use of the Fetch API to perform HTTP requests to the backend server. The server stores the movie data and provides endpoints for fetching all movies, updating tickets purchased.

The frontend code is built with `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript`. It uses `DOM manipulation` to dynamically render the animal cards and handle user interactions such as viewing movie trailers, purchasing tickets. Event listeners are attached to the purchase buttons and card click to perform the corresponding actions.


Overall, this project provides an interactive and engaging user experience for viewing movie details.
