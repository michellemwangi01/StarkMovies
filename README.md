The application utilizes JavaScript and interacts with a RESTful API to retrieve and update data. It makes use of the Fetch API to perform HTTP requests to the backend server. The server stores the movie data and provides endpoints for fetching all movies, updating tickets purchased.

The frontend code is built with `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript`. It uses `DOM manipulation` to dynamically render the animal cards and handle user interactions such as viewing movie trailers, purchasing tickets. Event listeners are attached to the purchase buttons and card click to perform the corresponding actions.


Overall, this project provides an interactive and engaging user experience for viewing movie details.
